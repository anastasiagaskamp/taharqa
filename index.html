          it is a sign in hieroglyphs." class="thumbnail">
          <p>
            The upper left corner of this image shows the pyramid that this tomb is located below. The image below the pyramid is a sign
            within the tomb that is written in hieroglyphs. Translation can be found <a href="#writing">here</a>.
            <br/>The right of this image is the interior of the tomb. It is located underneath a pyramid, with a
            <a href="#trap">booby trap</a> near the front. Here, there is also a <a href="#writing">sign in hieroglyphs</a>.
             Past the booby trap, several <a href="#paintings">paintings</a> are located, which show various gods and activities. In
              front of the <a href="#coffin">sarcophagus</a> is placed a <a href="#items">basket with several possessions</a>, all of which are
               needed for the Egyptian afterlife. More information can be found below.</p>

          <h3>Booby Trap</h3>
          <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/qclarinetx/image/upload/v1483876974/trap_j0bybx.png" alt="The Booby Trap">
          <p>This trap works through being stones patterned across the floor. It becomes activated through a person stepping on the wrong symbol.
            If the wrong symbol is stepped on, the stone moves away to show a hole in the floor, causing
            the person to fall into a pit, which contains spikes at the bottom that should kill the person once they hit the bottom.
            If the person gets across successfully, they enter the tomb.</p>

          <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/qclarinetx/image/upload/v1483876974/Basket_Possessions_bjy3kq.png" alt="Taharqa's possessions." title="Taharqa's possessions.">
          <p>Items:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Shabti</li>
            <ul>
              <li>This item was chosen because of Egyptian beliefs about the afterlife. According to their beliefs, they would continue to work in the afterlife.
                The shabti were created
                to help them with tasks,
                as, in the afterlife, they would come to life to
                help their owner.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Scarab</li>
            <ul>
              <li>This item was also chosen because of Egyptian beliefs about the afterlife. According to their beliefs, they had to be 'pure' to
                make it into the afterlife. The scarab protects the person's heart
                from when they lie, and say that they didn't do
                something that they actually did do.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Bread</li>
            <ul>
              <li>This item was chosen for the Egyptian afterlife because, in their afterlife, the person would need food.
                 With bread being a basic foodstuff for the Egyptians, this was a good choice for the afterlife.</li>

          <li>This shows Taharqa ruling over his people, who are represented to be much smaller than him because of their lack of importance.
          </li>
            <li>This shows Anubis, who is known as a god of the dead. He did the weighing of the soul in Egyptian mythology, in which the
              person's soul is weighed with the feather.</li>
